# LuggageShare

## Problem Statement

International students in China face significant challenges when trying to send or receive goods from their families back home. With over **500,000 international students** in China, the demand for affordable and reliable shipping is massive. Current options are either too expensive or too slow.

### Current Shipping Challenges

- **Traditional Services** (DHL, SF Express): 2+ weeks delivery, 3-5x more expensive than peer-to-peer
- **Sea Freight**: 6-8 weeks delivery, high risk of lost or misplaced goods
- **Informal WeChat Groups**: 1-3 days delivery but riddled with safety concerns and data exposure

### The Statistics

- **43%** of students report safety issues with informal networks
- **35%** experience delays or lost items
- **$150-300** average cost for traditional international shipping
- **60%** of students rely on unreliable social media groups
