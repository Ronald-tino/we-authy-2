# Profile Save Fix - Setup & Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd Api
npm install
```

This will install the `cloudinary` package that was added to `package.json`.

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure your `Api/.env` file has these Cloudinary settings:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzmrfifoq
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

> **Note**: The cloud name is already in the code. If you need API key/secret, get them from [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console).

### Step 3: Restart Backend

```bash
# In Api directory
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Frontend

```bash
# In Client directory (separate terminal)
npm run dev
```

2. Verify upload preset "lugshare" exists in Cloudinary
3. Check console for error messages

### Issue: Old images not deleting

**Solution**:

1. Check backend console for deletion logs
2. Verify Cloudinary API key/secret are correct
3. Make sure old image is actually from Cloudinary (not default avatar)

- API call happens in background
- Total time: ~200-500ms

### Image Deletion:

- Happens async on server
- Doesn't block profile update response
- Logged to console for debugging
