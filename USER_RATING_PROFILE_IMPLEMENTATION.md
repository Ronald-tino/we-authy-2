# User Rating and Profile System Implementation - Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive user rating display system and public profile viewing functionality. Users can now click on usernames/avatars throughout the app to view public profiles with visual star ratings.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Public Profile Endpoint

**Files Modified:**

- `Api/controllers/user.controller.js` - Added `getPublicUser` controller
- `Api/routes/user.route.js` - Added `GET /users/public/:id` route

**What it does:**

- Returns only public user information (username, img, country, desc, isSeller, totalStars, starNumber, tripsCompleted, createdAt)
- Excludes sensitive data like email, phone, and password
- No authentication required for viewing public profiles

### Frontend Changes

#### 2. Star Rating Component

**New Files:**

- `Client/src/components/StarRating/StarRating.jsx`
- `Client/src/components/StarRating/StarRating.scss`

**Features:**

- Displays visual star ratings (filled, half-filled, and empty stars)
- Shows numeric rating with optional review count
- Three size variants: small, medium, large
- Calculates and displays average rating from totalStars/starNumber
- Example: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ 4.2 (15)

#### 3. Profile Page - Dual Mode Support

**Files Modified:**

- `Client/src/pages/profile/Profile.jsx`
- `Client/src/pages/profile/Profile.scss`
- `Client/src/App.jsx` - Added `/profile/:userId` route

**Two Modes:**

**Own Profile Mode** (when viewing your own profile):

- Full edit capabilities
- Shows contact information (email, phone)
- Can upload profile image
- Can edit bio, location, phone
- Shows "Edit Profile" button

**Public Profile Mode** (when viewing others' profiles):

- Read-only view
- Hides contact information (email, phone)
- Shows "Public Profile" badge
- Displays username, nationality, location, bio, rating, and trips completed
- No edit controls visible

**Star Rating Display:**

- Visual star rating prominently displayed in profile header
- Shows numeric rating and review count
- Highlighted in a special badge with gradient background

#### 4. Clickable Usernames/Avatars

**Files Modified:**

**GigCard Component** (`Client/src/components/GiGcard/GigCard.jsx` + `.scss`):

- Wrapped user avatar and name in NavLink to `/profile/:userId`
- Added hover effects (scale avatar, highlight username, background tint)
- Prevents event propagation to avoid navigating to gig detail

**Review Component** (`Client/src/components/Review/Review.jsx` + `.scss`):

- Wrapped user info section in Link to `/profile/:userId`
- Added hover effects (scale avatar, highlight username, background glow)

**Messages Page** (`Client/src/pages/messages/Messages.jsx` + `.scss`):

- Split conversation card into clickable sections:
  - Avatar links to user profile
  - Conversation content links to message thread
- Calculates correct otherUserId based on current user's role
- Added hover effects on avatar

**Message Page** (`Client/src/pages/message/Message.jsx` + `.scss`):

- Made chat header user info clickable
- Links to other user's profile
- Added hover effects (scale avatar, highlight name)

### Styling Enhancements

**All clickable user elements now have:**

- Smooth hover transitions
- Avatar scale effect on hover
- Username color change to brand green
- Subtle background highlight
- Cursor changes to pointer
- Border color changes on avatar

**Profile-specific styles:**

- `.profile-rating` - Gradient badge for star rating display
- `.public-profile-badge` - Blue gradient badge indicating public view
- Responsive design maintained across all screen sizes

## User Experience Flow

1. **Viewing Ratings:**

   - Users see visual star ratings on profile pages
   - Ratings calculated from totalStars/starNumber fields
   - Shows as "N/A" if no reviews yet

2. **Accessing Profiles:**

   - Click any username or avatar in:
     - Gig cards (marketplace listings)
     - Reviews
     - Message conversations
     - Chat headers
   - Instantly navigate to that user's public profile

3. **Profile Information:**
   - Own profile: Full access with edit controls
   - Other profiles: Public info only (username, location, bio, rating, trips)
   - Clear visual indication with "Public Profile" badge

## Technical Implementation

**State Management:**

- Uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Optimistic updates on own profile edits
- Separate query keys for own profile vs public profiles

**Routing:**

- `/profile` - Own profile
- `/profile/:userId` - Public profile of specific user
- Dynamic rendering based on userId param

**Security:**

- Public endpoint doesn't require authentication
- Sensitive fields excluded from public API response
- Own profile still protected behind auth for editing
