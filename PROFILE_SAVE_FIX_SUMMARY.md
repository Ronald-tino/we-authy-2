# Profile Save Functionality - Modern Implementation Summary

## Overview

The profile save functionality has been completely overhauled to match modern web application standards with optimistic UI updates, proper Cloudinary integration, and enhanced user feedback.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend: Cloudinary Integration & Image Deletion

#### Files Modified:

- `Api/package.json` - Added cloudinary dependency
- `Api/server.js` - Configured Cloudinary with credentials
- `Api/controllers/user.controller.js` - Added image deletion logic

#### Key Features:

- **Automatic Old Image Deletion**: When a user uploads a new profile picture, the old one is automatically deleted from Cloudinary
- **Public ID Extraction**: Helper function `extractPublicId()` parses Cloudinary URLs to get the image ID
- **Error Handling**: Image deletion errors are logged but don't block profile updates
- **Smart Detection**: Only deletes images hosted on Cloudinary (skips default avatars)

```javascript
// Image deletion happens before updating
if (
  currentUser.img &&
  currentUser.img.includes("cloudinary") &&
  currentUser.img !== img.trim()
) {
  const publicId = extractPublicId(currentUser.img);
  if (publicId) {
    await cloudinary.uploader.destroy(publicId);
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Frontend: Real Cloudinary Upload (Not Base64)

#### File Modified:

- `Client/src/pages/profile/Profile.jsx`

#### Changes:

- **Import Upload Utility**: Uses existing `upload.js` utility
- **Real Upload**: Images uploaded to Cloudinary immediately when selected
- **Instant Preview**: Shows local preview while uploading (optimistic UX)
- **Upload State**: New `uploadingImage` state tracks upload progress
- **Proper Error Handling**: Shows toast on upload success/failure

```javascript
const handleImageChange = async (e) => {
  // Show preview immediately
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onloadend = () => setImagePreview(reader.result);
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);

  // Upload to Cloudinary in background
  setUploadingImage(true);
  const url = await upload(file);
  setProfileData((prev) => ({ ...prev, img: url }));
  setToast({ type: "success", message: "Image uploaded!" });
};
```

---

### 3. Optimistic UI Updates

#### File Modified:

- `Client/src/pages/profile/Profile.jsx`

#### Implementation:

Uses React Query's `onMutate`, `onError`, and `onSettled` lifecycle hooks:

**onMutate** (Before API call):

- Cancels any pending queries
- Snapshots current data for rollback
- Optimistically updates cache immediately
- UI reflects changes instantly

**onError** (If API fails):

- Rolls back cache to previous state
- Restores original profile data
- Shows error toast

**onSuccess** (After successful save):

- Updates localStorage
- Shows success toast
- Clears edit mode
- Updates original data reference

**onSettled** (Always):

- Invalidates cache to refetch fresh data
- Ensures server and client stay in sync

```javascript
onMutate: async (updatedData) => {
  await queryClient.cancelQueries(["user", currentUser._id]);
  const previousUser = queryClient.getQueryData(["user", currentUser._id]);

  // Update immediately
  queryClient.setQueryData(["user", currentUser._id], (old) => ({
    ...old,
    ...updatedData
  }));

  return { previousUser };
},
```

---

### 4. Enhanced Loading States

#### File Modified:

- `Client/src/pages/profile/Profile.jsx`

#### New States:

1. **Image Uploading**: Shows spinner overlay on avatar
2. **Profile Saving**: Shows spinner in save button
3. **Button Disabled**: Can't save while uploading or saving

#### Visual Feedback:

- **Upload Overlay**: Dark overlay with spinner on avatar during upload
- **Button States**:
  - Normal: "Save Changes" with checkmark icon
  - Uploading: "Uploading Image..." with spinner
  - Saving: "Saving..." with spinner
- **Disabled States**: Buttons disabled during async operations

```jsx
{
  uploadingImage && (
    <div className="upload-overlay">
      <div className="upload-spinner"></div>
      <span>Uploading...</span>
    </div>
  );
}

<button disabled={updateMutation.isPending || uploadingImage}>
  {uploadingImage ? "Uploading Image..." : "Save Changes"}
</button>;
```

---

### 5. Modern SCSS Animations

#### File Modified:

- `Client/src/pages/profile/Profile.scss`

#### New Styles:

- **Upload Overlay**: Semi-transparent black overlay on avatar
- **Upload Spinner**: White spinning loader
- **Fade-in Animation**: Smooth appearance of overlay
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

```scss
.upload-overlay {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease;

  .upload-spinner {
    width: 24px;
    height: 24px;
    border: 3px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
    border-top-color: white;
    animation: spin 0.6s linear infinite;
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Old Implementation):

1. User clicks edit
2. Selects image → stored as base64
3. Clicks save
4. Page refreshes or doesn't update
5. Old images pile up in Cloudinary
6. No feedback during operations

### After (New Implementation):

1. User clicks edit
2. Selects image:
   - **Instant preview** shows
   - **Upload overlay** appears on avatar
   - Image uploads to Cloudinary
   - **Toast notification**: "Image uploaded!"
3. User edits other fields
4. Clicks "Save Changes":
   - **UI updates immediately** (optimistic)
   - **Button shows spinner**: "Saving..."
   - API call in background
5. On success:
   - **Old image deleted** from Cloudinary
   - **Toast**: "Profile updated successfully!"
   - **Edit mode closes**
6. On error:
   - **Changes rolled back** automatically
   - **Toast**: Error message
   - **User can try again**

## Technical Details

### Cloudinary Configuration

Server-side configuration in `Api/server.js`:

```javascript
cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME || "dzmrfifoq",
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});
```

### Required Environment Variables

Add to `Api/.env`:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzmrfifoq
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

### Public ID Extraction Algorithm

Handles various Cloudinary URL formats:

- With version: `https://res.cloudinary.com/[cloud]/image/upload/v1234567890/[folder]/[id].jpg`
- Without version: `https://res.cloudinary.com/[cloud]/image/upload/[folder]/[id].jpg`
- Extracts: `[folder]/[id]` (without extension)
