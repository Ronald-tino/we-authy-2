            <p>
              Disputes between users should be resolved directly whenever
              possible. Our customer support team can facilitate communication

              For disputes with LuggageShare, please contact us first to seek an
              informal resolution. We are committed to addressing concerns
              fairly and promptly.
            </p>

            <h3>12.3 Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <p>
              If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you agree that disputes
              will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court,
              except for small claims court matters or intellectual property
              disputes.

            <h3>12.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>

              participate in class actions or class arbitrations.
