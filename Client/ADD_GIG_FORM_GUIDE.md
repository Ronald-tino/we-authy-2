### ❌ BAD EXAMPLE (Too Vague - Will Cause Issues)

```
I can transport stuff from Dubai to Lahore. Contact me for details.
```

**Why this is bad:**

- Doesn't specify what items are allowed
- No restrictions mentioned
- No experience or reliability information
- Too short and vague
- Clients won't know if their items can be transported

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Why You MUST Specify Goods Types

### 1. **Legal Protection**

- Prevents you from accidentally transporting prohibited items
- Protects you from legal liability
- Ensures compliance with customs regulations

### 2. **Customer Clarity**

- Clients know immediately if their items qualify
- Reduces misunderstandings and disputes
- Saves time for both parties

### 3. **Platform Quality**

- Maintains high service standards
- Builds trust in the marketplace
- Prevents errors and failed deliveries

### 4. **Backend Validation**

- The system requires detailed descriptions
- Forms with vague descriptions may be flagged
- Detailed listings get better visibility
